# Naming pattern: primary/secondary upper side number tooth
# {upper, lower} {primary,secondary} {tooth}
# def: {tooth} and part-of some {upper,lower} jaw region and part-of some {primary,secondary} dentition

# insicors reside in premaxilla
# canines, molars, and premolars reside in maxilla
## premaxilla and maxilla are both subclasses of upper jaw bone

## will need to make tooth first, separately (e.g., molar tooth 1 needs to already exist)
## in most cases, one will know if it is primary or secondary, as well as if it is upper or lower tooth.
## need to create combination of lower and primary/secondary, do know need to make them individually
# create upper secondary tooth and upper primary tooth with subclass: 'calcareous tooth' and 'part of' some 'jaw bone' and 'part of' some 'dentition'
## not doing side but leaving this here in case side is included in the future
# create right and left upper inscisor with subclass 'upper incisor'
# create right and left primary and secondary upper incisor with subclass 'primary upper incisor' and 'secondary upper incisor'
